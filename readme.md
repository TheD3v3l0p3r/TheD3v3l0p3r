Hi there.
I'm anon.
I am new to coding and wish to help others during my journey of becoming a professional programmer.
I'll be placing all of my project here in GitHub and sharing it on Twitter (or what they call X now).
All of my works are intended to help others learn how code works, so I'll be very descriptive and breakdown code for you.
I'll link all of my social media here soon, but goodbye for now. :)
