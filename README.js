/*
Hey there!
Welcome to my README page.
I am... what you would call a "Noob".
I'm currently learning Python and Javascript (JS).
I want to pursue a career in Cybersecurity, Data Science, and (possibly) Web Development.
I'm not looking for Collabs just yet; I might later on.
You can reach me at Telegram: , Facebook: , LinkedIn: , X (formerly, Twitter): ; Discord: .


"Learning ain't easy; doesn't have to be difficult either." That's my mono.
